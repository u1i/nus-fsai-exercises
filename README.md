# Exercises â€“ Full Stack with AI (NUS)

Here you will find the hands-on exercises for Modules 18 and 19 of the couse. These activities are designed to give you practical experience with some key concepts we've covered in class.

**Module 18: Performance Optimization and Scalability** explores how to make applications fast and handle growth, covering things like CDNs, caching, and scaling strategies.

**Module 19: Generative AI Application** got you into the exciting world of Large Language Models (LLMs), how to talk to them (prompting!), choose the right one, and integrate AI into your development workflow.

Let's get started!

## Exercises

*   **[Module 18 Exercise](): Exploring and Using CDNs**
    *   **What you'll do:** First, you'll see how a major site like CNN uses Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to deliver content blazing fast. Then, you'll deploy your *own* simple webpage to a global CDN in minutes using Surge.sh which will make the ideas of performance and scalability real.

*   **[Module 19 Exercise](): Exploring LLM Behavior with a Playground**
    *   **What you'll do:** Get hands-on with LLMs! Using an AI playground, you'll experiment with Google's Gemini models. You'll learn how to give an AI a personality using System Prompts, control its creativity with Temperature, and see how different models tackle creative tasks. It's a fun way to understand prompting and LLM tuning.

Good luck, and have fun experimenting!
